# How to build?
Building should be simple just need that Grass7 API, VS2015 recommended.
Place into system32 of target OS and config .gr7updatepkg files to launch with it.
# Why?
I needed a way of updating releases of Grass7 without making huge ass ISOs.
# Note
This version does NOT work with the files i release due to security reasons.
